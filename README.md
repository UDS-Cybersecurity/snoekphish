# üõ°Ô∏è UDS Phishing Detector Project - snoekphish

Welcome to the official project for the **UDS Cyber Security Division Phishing Detector**. This project aims to build a smart, privacy-conscious **phishing detection browser extension** powered by a hybrid detection engine (rule-based and ML).  

Version 1 will ship as a **browser extension** for detecting phishing attempts in real-time across websites and webmail clients.

## üöÄ Project Roadmap

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Planning & Research (Week 1)
- Define phishing indicators for browser-based attacks
- Research datasets and phishing signatures
- Explore extension APIs (Chrome/Firefox)
- Set up GitHub Organization and Repositories

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Architecture Design (Week 2)
- Define component architecture:
  - Browser extension (HTML/JS)
  - Detection engine (Python backend / WASM call)
  - Communication between extension & backend (e.g., local API or in-extension logic)
- Finalize tech stack & data flow

### üõ†Ô∏è Phase 3: Development (Weeks 3‚Äì6)

#### üîπ Browser Extension (Frontend)
- DOM scanner: Scan links, inputs, and text for phishing traits
- Visual indicators (red flag icon, warnings)
- UI/UX: Popup UI + Settings page

#### üîπ Detection Engine (Backend - Python)
- Rule-based logic (regex, domain match, content)
- ML model (TF-IDF, phishing word frequency, classifier)
- Create scoring/reporting mechanism

#### üîπ Communication Layer
- Interface between JS and Python (e.g., REST API or WASM if needed)

#### üîπ Output / Alerting
- Show safe/suspicious flags
- Provide risk scores and explain why a site is flagged

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Week 7)
- Connect browser extension to the backend engine
- Perform functional and phishing case testing
- Compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox)

### ‚úÖ Phase 5: Documentation & Deployment (Week 8)
- Finalize README files and user documentation
- Package extension for browser stores
- Launch GitHub pages or docs site
